# Deployment

What a deployment repository needs to know about this component, and where the
component says it.

## The two declarations

Two files describe this project, and they are not interchangeable.

**`component.toml` is the component's statement about itself.** It is `core`: it
ships in the reference application and in every component materialized from it,
so a component always has it. It carries

- `adopted_apps` — the reusable applications this component has adopted, in the
  order the settings composition applies them;
- `selected_features` — which of `celery`, `redis` and `storage` this
  combination selected;
- `[[databases]]` — per alias, whether the database is required and which
  release-stage migration steps to run before new pods serve;
- `[[processes]]` — the process group, with each process's replica count and
  replacement strategy;
- `[[admin_processes]]` — administrative processes, which are deliberately
  *outside* the process group and never declare `COMPONENT_PROCESS`.

**`accelerator.toml` is the accelerator's knowledge about all components.** It is
`machinery`: it stays in this repository and never travels. It carries feature
surfaces, input dispositions, parameter sites, presets, the closed contributable
surface and the pinned verification subset.

The rule for placing anything new:

> A rule the component must obey at **runtime or deploy time** goes in
> `component.toml`. A rule **only the materializer needs** goes in
> `accelerator.toml`.

The reason is not tidiness. `accelerator.toml` does not travel, so a runtime rule
written there is a rule a materialized component cannot read — it would be unable
to adopt a reusable app, declare an extra migration step, or state that a
database is optional, because every one of those rules lived in a file it does
not have. Conversely, a disposition or a preset written into `component.toml`
would ship a materializer concern to every component and give the accelerator two
places to look.

`tests/unit/test_component_declaration.py` enforces the split mechanically: the
top-level key set of `component.toml` must be a subset of `component`,
`adopted_apps`, `selected_features`, `databases`, `processes` and
`admin_processes`. Anything else fails the gate.

`selected_features` is the one entry that looks like an accelerator concern and
is not. The accelerator declares what each feature *is*; `component.toml`
declares which ones *this component has*, and it is the only declaration of that
present when settings are imported in both the reference application and a
materialized component.

## Process model

The component's process types are **pixi tasks**. The deployment repository
invokes them directly:

```sh
pixi run web      # gunicorn + the uvicorn worker class
pixi run worker   # the Celery worker  (only where `celery` is selected)
pixi run beat     # the Celery scheduler (only where `celery` is selected)
```

and enumerates the set with `pixi task list`, which prints each one beside its
description. **There is no Procfile, and none will be added** — a Procfile is a
file the deployment repository may not read, and it would be a second place the
process model is written. Materialized components ship no Dockerfile either, so
`pixi run <process>` against the golden base *is* the invocation path.

`web` exists in all six combinations. `worker` and `beat` exist only where
background task processing is selected, so in `pixi.toml` they sit inside paired
`# feature:celery` / `# /feature:celery` line comments and are removed with the
feature — rather than surviving into a component with no broker that the
deployment repository would then try to run.

Replica counts and replacement strategy are **not** in `pixi.toml`; a task cannot
express them. They are in `component.toml`, one `[[processes]]` entry per process
type:

| Process | Replicas | Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| `web` | the platform's to choose | `rolling` |
| `worker` | the platform's to choose | `rolling` |
| `beat` | exactly `1` | `stop-before-start` |

`beat` is the one that constrains the platform. Its schedule lives in
PostgreSQL, so it is replaceable but never duplicable: a second scheduler
double-enqueues every periodic task, and a default rolling update produces
exactly that second scheduler for the length of the overlap. The replica count
and the replacement strategy are therefore one decision, not two.

`tests/unit/test_process_model.py` reconciles the two files in **both**
directions: every process type `component.toml` names has a matching task, and
every task in the process group is named by `component.toml`. Membership in the
process group is structural — a task is in it when its `env` declares
`COMPONENT_PROCESS`, whatever the task is called.

### The two variables, and which way each one fails

A process task declares `COMPONENT_PROCESS` in its own `env` and declares **no**
`COMPONENT_RUNTIME`, thereby inheriting *deployed*. The two variables fail in
opposite directions, deliberately:

- **Locality fails closed.** An absent or unrecognized `COMPONENT_RUNTIME` means
  *deployed*, so a declaration lost between the manifest and production leaves
  every refusal armed rather than disarmed.
- **Process type fails open.** An absent `COMPONENT_PROCESS` means *not a serving
  process*. Failing it closed would make every command that ran without it a
  serving process — `pixi run migrate` included, which is a release-stage step —
  and it would then refuse on the unapplied-migrations condition and deadlock the
  release. The accepted price is that a serving process started outside the `web`
  task does not fire that refusal.

This is also why `COMPONENT_PROCESS` may not appear in any pixi activation env,
feature-scoped ones included: the golden base runs pixi, so activation env
reaches production, and one placed there would produce that deadlock on every
release.

The grace period is not the component's to state. `web`'s command encodes no
timeout and no port — `GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS` is gunicorn's own injection point for
`--bind`, worker counts and the graceful-shutdown timeout, so the deployment
repository sets them without a component-side flag.

### The deployment platform must set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`

It is not optional, and the failure when it is missing is loud rather than
subtle. `config/asgi.py` falls back to `config.settings.local`, and stage-1
condition 1 (`_refuse_the_local_settings_module`) refuses a *deployed* process
that loaded the local settings module. So a platform that forgets the variable
gets a refusal at settings import, not a component quietly serving with
`DEBUG=True`. That is why the entrypoint's fallback is left as it is: it already
fails closed.

`pixi run serve` is **not** a process type. It is the cross-platform local ASGI
server — uvicorn directly, because gunicorn has no conda-forge win-64 build —
and it is invoked as `pixi run -e dev serve`. A deployment runs `web`.

## Reading the declaration

`config.component.load_component_declaration()` parses the file into frozen
records and refuses anything malformed with `ImproperlyConfigured`. It resolves
`component.toml` from its own location rather than from a setting, and imports no
Django settings module, because the settings composition itself is one of its
callers.

The resolution walks up from the loader module — `component/` → `config/` →
`src/` → the directory holding `component.toml`. That holds in the source tree
and in the editable install the component runs from under `pixi run`, which is
where every consumer reads it today. It does **not** hold in a non-editable
install: the wheel is built with `only-include = ["src"]` and the sdist does not
list `component.toml` either, so a component installed from a built distribution
has nothing at that path and the loader raises its ordinary missing-file refusal.
Packaging the declaration into a built distribution is Story 5.6's call — the
component is a payload there — and it is deliberately not settled here.

```python
from config.component import load_component_declaration

declaration = load_component_declaration()
declaration.selected_features  # frozenset({"celery", "redis", "storage"})
declaration.databases[0].migrate  # ("migrate --database default --noinput",)
```

Because `component.toml` is a `core` file that carries lines belonging to a
single feature — the `worker` and `beat` processes exist only where `celery` is
selected — those lines sit inside paired `# feature:celery` / `# /feature:celery`
line comments. That is the only mechanism permitted for removing part of a `core`
file, and it is what keeps the process declarations in step with the pixi tasks
in every combination — `pixi.toml` carries the matching `# feature:celery` region
around its own `worker` and `beat` tasks.

The rule for the process group is that each member declares `COMPONENT_PROCESS`
through the pixi task its `task` field names, which is what
[Process model](#process-model) above describes and what
`tests/unit/test_process_model.py` reconciles in both directions.

## Migrations are a release-stage step

**Migration runs before new pods begin serving, and no process the component
starts performs it.** No entrypoint, no serving-process task and no container
command migrates, and none will be added. That is not an oversight to be
corrected in your deployment repository by adding one — it is the contract, and
the component is built to make the omission safe.

`pixi.toml` does declare a `migrate` task, and it is not a counter-example. It is
a management command — the release stage's own invocation surface, and a
developer's — and it declares no `COMPONENT_PROCESS`, so it is not a serving
process. What the contract forbids is any path from a process that serves
requests to a migration, whether written into its command or reached through
`depends-on`; `tests/unit/test_release_stage.py` asserts both, transitively.

The reason is the race. An entrypoint that migrates runs once per replica, so a
rolling deploy of three replicas starts three concurrent `migrate` invocations
against the same database. The winner applies the schema; the losers do
something between failing loudly and half-applying a data migration. There is no
locking that makes this correct in general, so the invocation is moved to a stage
where there is exactly one of it.

### The ordering your deployment repository must implement

1. **Apply migrations.** Run each step `component.toml` declares, once per
   database, to completion. Nothing else has started.
2. **Start the new replicas.** They boot against a schema that is already
   current.
3. **Let the old replicas drain.** They leave the routing pool on their own
   terms — see [Shutdown](#shutdown).

Step 1 finishing before step 2 begins is the whole property. If your platform
runs the migration as a pre-deploy hook, it must be a *blocking* one.

### One step per database, exactly as `component.toml` declares

The steps are not inferred and must not be guessed. Each `[[databases]]` entry
carries a `migrate` list, one entry per invocation:

```toml
[[databases]]
alias = "default"
required = true
migrate = ["migrate --database default --noinput"]
```

Each step is arguments to a Django management command, so the release stage runs
it through pixi:

```sh
pixi run manage migrate --database default --noinput
```

Every step names its target alias explicitly with `--database`. A component that
adopts a reusable application bringing its own database adds an alias here with
its own step, and the release stage picks it up without any change on your side —
which only works because no step relies on `default` being implied.
`tests/unit/test_release_stage.py` asserts that each declared step is a real
management command and names the alias of the entry that declares it.

There is deliberately **no** component-side task that runs every step in
sequence. One name that migrates everything is one `depends-on` away from
becoming the entrypoint this contract exists to prevent.

### The component refuses to serve an unrecognized schema

Migration state is checked once, at process start. A serving process that finds
unapplied migrations on any configured alias raises `ImproperlyConfigured` and
does not serve — the stage-2 refusal in `src/config/startup/`, which names the
alias and the pending migrations so the message says which database was never
migrated rather than that something is pending somewhere.

This is what makes step 1 above enforceable rather than advisory: a deployment
that starts new pods without migrating gets a process that refuses to start,
which your platform surfaces as a failed rollout, instead of a process that
serves requests against a schema it does not know.

Readiness does **not** re-ask the question — see
[Readiness deliberately does not re-check migrations](#readiness-deliberately-does-not-re-check-migrations).
The two rules fit together: during the rollout every still-serving replica of the
old generation is running against a newer schema, which is precisely what
backwards-compatible migrations are for, and a readiness probe that compared
migration state would drain that entire generation at once and turn a routine
migration into an outage. Refuse at start, never re-check while serving.

### Accepted risk R-3: the refusal only fires for a declared process

The refusal applies to serving processes, and a process is a serving process only
when it declares `COMPONENT_PROCESS` — which the `web` pixi task does, and
`worker` and `beat` where `celery` is selected, and nothing else does. **A
serving process started outside those tasks does not fire the migrations
refusal.** A hand-rolled `gunicorn
config.asgi:application`, or a platform manifest that invokes the server binary
directly instead of `pixi run web`, will start against an unmigrated schema and
serve.

This is recorded as risk **R-3**, and it is accepted rather than mitigated.

Closing it would mean failing the process-type check *closed* — treating
"`COMPONENT_PROCESS` is absent" as "assume this is a serving process". That
inverts into a deadlock immediately: `pixi run migrate` is a management command
and declares no process type, so it would be treated as a serving process, refuse
on the unapplied migrations it was invoked to apply, and leave the release stage
with no way to clear a state only it could clear. The refusal would forbid the
one action that resolves it.

So the price is paid deliberately, and it is a small one, because it is bounded
by a rule you already have to follow: **start processes with `pixi run <process>`,
as [Process model](#process-model) describes.** Every process type the deployment
repository is told to start is a pixi task, that is the only invocation path the
component declares, and a process started any other way is outside the contract
in more ways than this one.

## Health endpoints

Two routes, at the root of the component, reachable with no credential:

| Path | Wire it to | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| `/livez` | the **liveness** probe | `200` with a plain-text body while the process is running |
| `/readyz` | the **readiness** probe | `200` with `{"status": "ready", …}` when the process should be routed to, `503` with `{"status": "unready", …}` when it should not |

Both accept `GET` and `HEAD`, answer `405` to anything else, and carry no-cache
headers so nothing between the probe and the process answers on its behalf.

### They are not interchangeable, and swapping them causes an outage

**Wire liveness to the liveness probe and readiness to the readiness probe, never
the reverse.** The two mean deliberately different things, and the platform's
reactions to them are deliberately different too.

`/livez` checks **nothing external**. It opens no database connection, reads no
cache, resolves no user and makes no network call. The process either answers it
or it does not, and "it does not" is the only signal a liveness probe is entitled
to act on — because the action it takes is to *kill the process*. This is why the
endpoint is so aggressively empty: a liveness check that touched the database
would turn a thirty-second database outage into every replica of every component
being restarted at once, which is the failure the split exists to prevent.

`/readyz` checks that **every required database answers**. Failing it removes the
pod from the load balancer's pool and *leaves the process alive*, which is the
correct response to a dependency being briefly unavailable: the component
degrades and then recovers on its own, instead of crash-looping.

Point the liveness probe at `/readyz` and you have built exactly the outage the
two endpoints exist to avoid — the database blinks, every replica fails its
liveness check, and the platform restarts the entire estate.

### Readiness is non-200 from process start until first contact

A process that has booted but has not yet successfully reached its databases
answers `503`. That is a deliberate property, not a startup race: a replica is
not ready because it started, it is ready because it has proved it can talk to
what it needs. The flag is per-process and lives in process memory, so a restart
does not inherit another replica's proof — and nothing about it is shared across
replicas or written to disk.

Give the readiness probe a `failureThreshold` and `initialDelaySeconds` that
tolerate this, and expect the first probe after a start to fail.

A process that has begun shutting down also answers `503`, before it looks at any
database, so that it leaves the routing pool before it finishes its in-flight
work.

### Readiness deliberately does not re-check migrations

`/readyz` opens a cursor on each required alias and issues `SELECT 1`. It does
**not** compare the migration graph against `django_migrations`, run
`migrate --check`, or ask any other question about the schema, and that is a
decision rather than an omission.

During a rolling deploy the release stage migrates *first* and new pods start
*after*, so for the length of the rollout every still-serving replica of the old
generation is running against a newer schema and sees migrations it has not
applied. That state is legitimate — it is precisely what backwards-compatible
migrations are for. A readiness check that compared migration state would report
every one of those replicas unready, drain the whole old generation at once, and
turn a routine migration into an outage.

Migration state *is* checked, once, at process start, by the startup refusal
contract. It is not re-asked on every probe.
`tests/integration/test_health.py` asserts that readiness still answers `200`
with an unapplied migration present, so this cannot regress quietly.

### Which required means what

An alias is required unless `component.toml` declares `required = false` for it
— see [The two declarations](#the-two-declarations). An alias that
`DATABASES` configures and `component.toml` does not declare at all is treated as
required and logged by name; it is never silently skipped.

The response body names every alias it asked:

```json
{"status": "ready", "databases": {"default": "ok"}}
```

### The `Host` header is the deployment repository's to get right

Platform probes commonly send the **pod IP** as the `Host` header rather than a
service name. `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is environment-driven —
`DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, read in `config/settings/production.py` — and Django
rejects a request whose `Host` is not in it with `400`, before any view runs. A
probe that gets a `400` reads it as a failure.

So the deployment repository must do one of two things:

- set an explicit `Host` header (or `httpHeaders`) on both probes to a value
  `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` contains; or
- include the pod IP range in `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

**Do not weaken `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in the component to work around this.** A
wildcard baked into the component travels into every component materialized from
it and disables Django's host validation everywhere, in exchange for saving one
line in one manifest.

## Shutdown

On `SIGTERM` the component flips readiness first, and only then drains.

1. The process marks itself draining. `/readyz` answers `503` from that moment
   on, before it looks at any database.
2. The load balancer sees the first `503` and removes the replica from its pool,
   so no new request is routed here.
3. The server stops accepting connections, finishes the requests already in
   flight, and exits.

A Celery worker does the same thing in its own terms: it stops consuming new
messages and finishes the task it is holding.

**The component owns the ordering; the grace period value is the deployment
repository's setting.** The ordering is the half that cannot be configured from
outside — it is what stops the process finishing in-flight work while traffic is
still arriving — and it ships with the component. The two knobs that decide how
long the drain is allowed to take are yours:

| Knob | Where it lives | What it bounds |
|---|---|---|
| the platform's termination grace period | your deployment manifest (`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` on Kubernetes) | how long after `SIGTERM` the platform waits before `SIGKILL` |
| `GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS` | the process environment you set for the `web` process | gunicorn's own `--graceful-timeout`, alongside `--bind` and worker counts |

Set the platform's grace period *longer* than gunicorn's graceful timeout. The
other way round, `SIGKILL` arrives while requests are still being finished and
the drain buys nothing.

### The platform must keep probing readiness during the drain

The flip is only useful if something reads it. A readiness probe whose interval
is longer than the grace period may never run between the `SIGTERM` and the
process exiting, in which case the load balancer removes the replica because it
stopped answering rather than because it said it was draining — which is the
dropped-request window the flip exists to close. Keep `periodSeconds` well
inside the grace period, and let the load balancer deregister on the first `503`
rather than after a failure threshold, so the pool is updated once and early.

### A second `SIGTERM` is a cold shutdown, and that is your choice

Celery treats a second `SIGTERM` as a *cold* shutdown: it stops waiting for the
running task and terminates. The component neither sends that second signal nor
prevents it. Whether one is sent — and how long the platform waits before
sending it — is a deployment-repository decision, made with the same grace period
above, and it is the point at which unfinished work is deliberately abandoned.

### What the component does not decide

The grace period value, the probe interval, and the load balancer's
deregistration behaviour are all outside this repository. Nothing in
`component.toml` or `pixi.toml` states them: `component.toml` carries replica
counts and replacement strategy, `pixi.toml` carries the commands, and neither
carries a timeout. The `web` command encodes no `--graceful-timeout` and the
`worker` command encodes no flag that alters Celery's warm shutdown — no
`--pool=solo`, no `-Ofair` — because both would take the decision away from you.
`tests/unit/test_process_model.py` holds that.

## The component is a payload

A component built from this accelerator is a **payload**, not an image. It starts
from environment variables alone, runs under a UID assigned by the platform that
the image has never seen, on a read-only root filesystem, and writes nothing
outside a temporary directory. Those are properties of the *application*, and
they are what let it be built by the platform's image pipeline rather than by a
build of its own.

### Materialized components ship no Dockerfile

The buildpack and golden-base path is the default. A materialized component
carries no `Dockerfile`, no `.dockerignore` and no per-component build
definition, and that is deliberate: a component that owns its own build also owns
its own base image, and a CVE in that base becomes one pull request per component
rather than one rebuild for all of them.

A component that genuinely needs its own build is a **deliberate departure** —
something to decide, record and justify, not something to reach for because a
`Dockerfile` is the familiar shape. Nothing prevents it. What the default
prevents is acquiring one by accident.

### The four legs of the zero-writable-path claim

"Writes nothing outside a temporary directory" is not a hope about the
application's behaviour. It is four decisions, each of which removed a reason to
write somewhere:

- **Static files are collected at build and served by the application.**
  `collectstatic` runs at build time, and `whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware`
  serves what it produced through `whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage`.
  There is no run-time collection step, no sidecar and no shared volume — so
  `STATIC_ROOT` is read-only in a running component.
- **User media is a non-goal.** No model declares a file field and nothing is
  saved through the default storage. The `MEDIA_ROOT` and `MEDIA_URL` settings
  and the `static()` media route in `config/urls.py` are still present and are
  inert: `django.conf.urls.static.static` returns nothing whenever `DEBUG` is
  false, so a deployed component mounts no media route at all. Removing the
  surface belongs to the object-storage work; until then its inertness is
  asserted rather than assumed.
- **Logs go to the event stream.** Structured JSON on stdout. No files, no
  rotation, no log directory, and nothing for the platform to mount.
- **Sessions are database-backed.** Not file-backed and not local: a session
  written to disk is per-replica, so a user's session would depend on which
  replica answered — which is the statelessness requirement lost through the one
  setting nobody looks at.

Each leg is asserted rather than asserted-about. `tests/unit/test_payload_properties.py`
holds the static half; `tests/integration/test_image_payload.py` builds the image,
runs it under `--user 12345:0 --read-only --tmpfs /tmp`, and requires that
`docker diff` on a *writable* run reports no changed path outside the temporary
directory.

### Running under an arbitrary UID

A platform that assigns UIDs gives the container a numeric identity that appears
nowhere in the image and has no `/etc/passwd` entry. Two things make that work,
and both are properties an image has to arrange in advance:

- **Group 0 has the owner's permissions on the application tree.** The assigned
  UID is placed in group 0, which is the only group membership such a platform
  guarantees, so access is granted through the group rather than through an
  ownership the image could not have predicted.
- **`HOME` points at the temporary directory.** With no passwd entry, `getpwuid`
  fails and everything resolving `$HOME` falls back to `/`, which is read-only.
  The failure surfaces as a permission error from whichever tool asked first,
  with nothing in the message about UIDs or filesystems.

### This repository's `Dockerfile` is machinery

There is a `Dockerfile` at the root of *this* repository. It is `machinery`: it
does not travel, it is not the deployment artefact, and nothing here pushes it
anywhere. It exists so the harness can *run* the payload properties instead of
believing them — build the image, start it under an arbitrary UID on a read-only
root filesystem, and check that it serves and writes nothing.

Its `CMD` is `pixi run web`, which is the same invocation a deployment repository
makes, so the image and the process model cannot declare two different things.
It applies no migrations at any depth: migration is a release-stage step, as
[Migrations are a release-stage step](#migrations-are-a-release-stage-step)
records.

One component shape inherits it. "Use this template" produces a **fork of this
base**, not a generated component, and that fork carries the machinery — the
materializer, `accelerator.toml` and this `Dockerfile` — so it *can* opt out of
the image pipeline where a materialized component cannot. That is a named
governed exception rather than an oversight, and it is accepted rather than
mitigated.

### What this does not deliver

This is the component-side half, and only that half. Nothing in this repository
starts a component on a platform.

The deployment configuration — manifests, the image pipeline itself, the golden
base image, the buildpack, replica counts as applied, probe intervals, grace
periods, secrets and their rotation — lives in a **separate repository** and is an
explicit non-goal here. This repository states what the component is and what it
needs; the deployment repository decides how it runs.

## Session and epoch pruning

**Sessions are database-backed in every combination, and you schedule the process
that prunes them.** `SESSION_ENGINE` is set explicitly in
`src/config/settings/base.py` to `django.contrib.sessions.backends.db`. It is set
there and nowhere else, outside every feature-owned region, so it is identical in
all six combinations — including the two that ship no Redis.

That explicitness is the point rather than the value. Django's own default is the
same string, so the line changes nothing today; what it removes is the component's
dependence on a default. A session engine nobody states is one a Django release
note can move and one a feature's settings fragment can quietly redefine — and a
cache-backed engine is per-replica wherever the cache is Django's in-process
backend, which is two of the six combinations. A user would then stay signed in
or not depending on which replica answered.

### One admin process prunes both tables

Two tables accumulate rows that stop mattering at a moment written into the row
itself: `django_session`, and the mapper's epoch table, which records the first
sighting of each credential. Nothing in the component removes a dead row from
either.

The component declares one admin process that removes both:

```
pixi run prune            # delete every expired session row and epoch record
pixi run prune --dry-run  # report what would be deleted, and delete nothing
```

It is idempotent and safe to run beside serving traffic, with one qualification
worth stating plainly rather than as "nothing is locked". Each leg issues a single
unbounded `DELETE ... WHERE <expiry> < cutoff` — no `LIMIT`, no chunking — so
PostgreSQL takes a row lock on every row that statement removes and holds it until
the statement ends. What it does **not** take is a table lock, and nothing here
truncates; and no row a live request is using is locked, because the predicate is
expiry and a live session's `expire_date` cannot satisfy it. Your serving traffic
is untouched by the locks.

It is still one statement, and that is the part to plan for. A **first** run
against a table nobody has pruned in months is a single large `DELETE`: it can
exceed the `statement_timeout` your platform or your connection sets and roll back
having made no progress at all — then do the same thing, at the same cost, the
next night. Size it with `--dry-run` before you schedule it, and if the count is
large, raise `statement_timeout` for that one job to get through the backlog.
Every run after it is small.

A second run a second later removes nothing and says so. Both events are still
written, each carrying zero, so a run with nothing to do is visible to your
alerting rather than indistinguishable from a job that stopped being scheduled.

Each run writes one structured event per kind with the row count, on the same
event stream as everything else; nothing in it is a session key or a token
identifier, and neither is the human-facing line on stdout.

The two legs are independent statements in autocommit — there is no transaction
around them, and that is deliberate. If the epoch leg fails after the session leg
has committed, the run exits non-zero **and** the session rows it already removed
stay removed, with `prune.sessions_pruned` already on the stream carrying its
count. Nothing has to be reconciled by hand: fix the cause and run it again. The
command is idempotent, so the re-run takes whatever expired in the meantime and
finishes the epoch leg.

### One residue this process does not remove

An epoch row whose `expires_at` is `NULL` is pruned by nothing, ever. That is
correct rather than an oversight, and it is stated here so you do not schedule
this job believing it bounds both tables without qualification.

The mapper writes `NULL` whenever the token it recorded carried no readable `exp`
— a missing claim, or one the platform cannot represent — and a null expiry means
the credential's end is unknown. Removing such a row by expiry would re-sync a
credential that may still be live, which is the failure the predicate is shaped to
avoid; `<` excludes `NULL` in SQL, which is how the exclusion is enforced.

So: `django_session` is bounded by this process without qualification, and the
epoch table is bounded only for the rows whose expiry was readable. If your IdP
issues tokens with no `exp`, those rows accumulate and nothing here will remove
them. Removing them needs a policy — an age cutoff, or a rule tying the row to
whether the identity still exists — and this repository does not take one, because
a wrong age deletes the record of a live credential. If it matters for your
estate, it is a decision to make in your repository with your IdP's behaviour in
front of you.

**It is deliberately not a background task, and that is not a preference.**
Background task processing exists in only two of the six combinations. A Celery
beat entry would therefore prune nothing at all in the other four, and those four
are precisely the deployments with no worker fleet to notice — the session table
would grow without bound while a scheduled job that does not exist reported
nothing wrong.

### The schedule is yours; the process is the component's

The component declares that the process exists and what it is called, in
`component.toml`:

```toml
[[admin_processes]]
name = "prune"
task = "prune"
schedule = "deployment-repository"
```

`schedule = "deployment-repository"` is the whole of the schedule the component
states. **Pick the cadence yourself** — daily is ample for most estates — and run
it the way your platform runs one-off jobs. Do not add a cron expression or an
interval to `component.toml`; nothing reads one, and a cadence written into the
component is a cadence that ships to every deployment whatever its traffic.

**What the job needs in its environment.** The same configuration a serving
process gets. `pixi run prune` is a Django management command, so it imports the
settings module before it does anything at all: it needs
`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`, the database URL, and every variable the startup
refusals require. A one-off job given a trimmed-down environment does not run a
smaller version of the work — it refuses at import.

The failure mode is worth knowing by sight, because it names the wrong thing.
`prune_expired_state` is an *application* command, contributed by an installed
app, so Django's management utility can only see it once the settings import
succeeds. When they do not import, the utility falls back to listing the commands
it ships with, and the job reports:

```
Unknown command: 'prune_expired_state'
Type 'manage.py help' for usage.
```

That is a misconfigured environment. It is not a missing command, not a wrong task
name and not a component that failed to ship the process — so check
`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` and the variables the settings module reads before you go
looking for anything else.

This is a phase boundary rather than an omission. The explicit engine is phase-1
and is delivered here; the *scheduling* half of the requirement is marked **Next**
and belongs to your repository in the same way the grace period, the probe
interval and the replica counts as applied do.

The `prune` task declares no `env` table at all, and both halves of that matter to
you. It sets no `COMPONENT_PROCESS`, because an admin process is not a serving
process: one that said it was would fire the serving-process refusals — the
unapplied-migrations one included — on the very maintenance it was invoked to do.
And it sets no `COMPONENT_RUNTIME`, because locality is declared by the
environment your platform supplies, never by a task.

### What this section does not change

Session *cookie* hardening is unchanged by any of the above and lives where it
already did, in `src/config/settings/production.py`: `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True`
and `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME = "__Secure-sessionid"`. Those govern how the session
cookie travels; the engine governs where the session is stored. They are named
here only so you do not go looking for them somewhere else.

`tests/unit/test_session_settings.py` holds the engine — set in `base.py`, set
exactly once, set in no other settings module, and inside no feature-owned region.
`tests/unit/test_process_model.py` holds the declaration: every declared admin
process names a task `pixi.toml` actually has, in the root `[tasks]` table rather
than under a feature or a platform; that task's command names a management command
Django actually has, so the `Unknown command` above cannot be reached by a typo
that got through review; and no admin process runs a task that declares a process
type. `tests/integration/test_prune_command.py` holds the behaviour against a real
database, including the two boundaries a review will not catch — an epoch record
whose expiry was never readable is *not* prunable by expiry and survives, and one
whose token is still inside the configured clock-skew leeway survives too, because
the Bearer path would still accept it.
