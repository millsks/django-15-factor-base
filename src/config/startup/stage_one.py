"""Stage 1 of the refusal contract: the checks that evaluate at settings import.

Called as the last statement of every leaf settings module, with that module's
own namespace as its argument. The namespace is passed rather than read off
`django.conf.settings` because `django.conf.settings` is not yet populated while
a settings module is still executing -- the module object is the only place the
composed values exist at that moment. Conditions read candidate names off it
with `getattr(module, name, default)`.

Every condition is deployed-only, so the whole stage returns before any of them
runs when `is_deployed()` is false. That is what keeps the entire developer and
CI surface -- all of which run local (AD-13) -- from refusing the moment this
contract lands.

A condition raises `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` and nothing
else. Never `warnings.warn`, never a log-and-continue branch: CG-3 exists
because a refusal softened into a warning makes deployment smoother and puts
local credentials into production.

Eight conditions live here. Six are unconditional: FR-12's settings-module
escape route, and conditions 1 to 5 of the refusal table -- the sqlite backend
over *every* configured alias (AD-9), the four local credential paths, the
OpenTelemetry kill switch, the JWKS trust anchor, and the unconfigured claims
contract. Two are feature-scoped: conditions 8 and 9, an in-process cache
backend where the Redis feature is selected and eager task execution where
background task processing is selected. That is ten of the fourteen forbidden
states; conditions 6 and 7 and the stage-2 half of 5 are `stage_two.py`.

The two feature-scoped conditions are the only code in this module that is not
present in every combination, and the *only* mechanism that removes them is
AD-24's paired line comments. There is no runtime "is the feature selected?"
branch and there must never be one: AD-3 makes materialization subtractive, so a
combination without the feature does not contain the condition at all, and a
flag would leave the condition in the file with a second thing to keep in step.

**Region declarations, until Epic 7 moves them (AD-24, AD-1).** `accelerator.toml`
is the single declarative catalogue and it does not exist yet -- Epic 7 authors
it and moves these declarations into it without changing what any one of them
means. Until then this is their declaration site, and it is read as one:
`tests/unit/startup/test_feature_scoped_refusals.py` parses the bullets below
and reconciles them against the markers actually present in each path it names,
in both directions. Only the opening of each bullet is parsed -- the word "path"
and the repository-relative path in backticks, then the word "feature" and the
feature name in backticks, in that order. Everything after that is prose
describing what the region holds, and rewriting it breaks nothing.

* path `src/config/startup/stage_one.py`, feature `redis`, delimited by
  `feature:redis` / `/feature:redis`. It contains condition 8,
  `_refuse_in_process_cache`, the tuple of backends it refuses, and the
  condition's entry in the `_STAGE_ONE` roster. That is **two** marker pairs in
  this file, not one: a definition and its call site are not adjacent, and a
  region is a contiguous run of lines.
* path `src/config/startup/stage_one.py`, feature `celery`, delimited by
  `feature:celery` / `/feature:celery`. It contains condition 9,
  `_refuse_eager_tasks`, and the condition's entry in the `_STAGE_ONE` roster --
  likewise two pairs, for the same reason.
* path `tests/unit/startup/test_stage_one_conditions.py`, feature `redis`. It
  contains `_refuse_in_process_cache`'s name in `EXPECTED_EVALUATION_ORDER`,
  which pins the roster by name and order: in a combination that did not select
  Redis the roster loses that entry, so an expectation naming it would fail on a
  tree that is correct.
* path `tests/unit/startup/test_stage_one_conditions.py`, feature `celery`. It
  contains `_refuse_eager_tasks`'s name in the same tuple, for the same reason.
* path `tests/unit/startup/test_feature_scoped_refusals.py`, feature `redis`. It
  contains the cache dotted paths and the `LocMemCache` subclass condition 8 is
  driven with, the `CACHES` builder, the `redis` entry in that module's
  feature-to-condition mapping, and the whole test class for condition 8. The
  spine's Test-location convention is what puts them here: a feature's tests
  carry that feature's disposition and are pruned with it.
* path `tests/unit/startup/test_feature_scoped_refusals.py`, feature `celery`.
  It contains the `celery` entry in the same mapping and the whole test class
  for condition 9.
* path `tests/unit/startup/forbidden_states.py`, feature `redis`. It contains
  the `ForbiddenState` record naming condition 8's state. That file is FR-16's
  index of forbidden states, and a combination without Redis has no such state
  to demand a test for.
* path `tests/unit/startup/forbidden_states.py`, feature `celery`. It contains
  the record naming condition 9's state, for the same reason.
* path `tests/unit/startup/test_refusal_coverage_audit.py`, feature `redis`. It
  contains the `redis` entries in that module's conditional-state and
  conditional-condition expectations, which are what fix the total at fourteen
  and the conditions at nine without either literal: both shrink with the
  declaration they audit.
* path `tests/unit/startup/test_refusal_coverage_audit.py`, feature `celery`.
  It contains the `celery` entries in the same two mappings, for the same
  reason.
* path `tests/unit/startup/test_no_softening.py`, feature `redis`. Two pairs in
  that file: the builder that constructs condition 8's forbidden state together
  with its entry in the CG-3 refusal mapping, and -- separately, near the top --
  the `stage_one.py` entry in `BROAD_EXCEPT_ALLOWANCE`. The allowance records
  the `except Exception` guarding `import_string` a few lines below, which is
  itself inside this file's `feature:redis` region; a combination without Redis
  loses the handler, so an allowance left behind would fail a tree that is
  correct.
* path `tests/unit/startup/test_no_softening.py`, feature `celery`. It contains
  condition 9's builder and its entry in the refusal mapping.

**Where the blank lines go is part of each region.** Every closing marker sits
directly beneath the blank lines that separate its region from whatever follows,
so removing the region takes that separation with it. The alternative -- markers
flush against the code with blank lines outside the pair on both sides -- leaves
six consecutive blank lines behind in a combination that dropped the region, and
`ruff format --check` then fails a materialized tree that is otherwise correct.
That was probed on a stripped copy rather than reasoned about.

The feature names are the ones the `[environments]` matrix will use (Epic 8):
`redis` and `celery`.

Nothing above says how many region-bearing paths this tree has, deliberately.
The set is open and the carrier declares it as an open array; an earlier
revision of AD-24 named three paths and was wrong, so a count written here would
be a claim about the whole tree maintained from inside one file of it.

One thing these declarations do **not** cover, recorded rather than hidden. The
three Django-core names condition 8 resolves its backends through -- `DummyCache`,
`LocMemCache` and `import_string` -- sit unmarked in the sorted import block
below. A marker pair inside that block does not survive `ruff`'s isort, which
reorders imports across it and carries the markers with whichever import they
attach to; that was probed rather than assumed. All three are Django's own, so
they resolve in every combination whether or not `redis` was selected, and what
removing the region leaves behind is an unused import rather than an
`ImportError`. Pruning it is the materializer's general orphan problem (Epic 8),
which AD-24's own worked example -- `CeleryInstrumentor` in a combination with no
instrumentor -- already puts on that epic.

**Nothing here re-declares what another module already owns (AD-1).** The
OpenTelemetry kill switch is read through `config.observability.telemetry`,
which is the module whose behaviour that variable changes; the JWKS derivation
rule and its explicit-or-conventional fallback are
`config.authorization.jwks`'s; the claims contract, its four variable names and
its `is_configured` predicate are `config.authorization.claims`'s. Each import
is unconditional and top-level, because AD-24 permits no `try`/`except
ImportError` and no conditional import inside this package.

#:    still executing -- which is inside `apps.populate(settings.INSTALLED_APPS)`,
#:    before the app registry is ready. `django.contrib.auth.backends` imports
#:    `django.contrib.auth.models`, and defining a model class with an unready
#:    registry raises `AppRegistryNotReady`. The same is true of

#: 2. *`issubclass` is the wrong predicate even where it works.*
#:    `allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend` -- the one backend a

    They are not collapsed into one aggregated error because FR-16 requires each
    to be testable separately, and because the four are fixed in four different
    places -- an operator handed "a local credential path is configured" has been
    told nothing they can act on.

    The four:

    * `ModelBackend` in `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` -- Django's own username and
      password check against the local user table, which is the credential FR-4
      moved to the IdP.
    * a non-empty `ACCOUNT_LOGIN_METHODS` -- allauth's local sign-in form,
      reachable whenever any login method is declared.
    * `DJANGO_ADMIN_FORCE_ALLAUTH` anything other than true -- `/admin/` serving
      Django's own credential form with the IdP never involved (FR-7).
    * the static-token surface -- `rest_framework.authtoken` installed, or
      `TokenAuthentication` among DRF's defaults. One state, two halves, because
      either half alone is a locally minted API credential.

    Every name is read off the module object rather than from
    `django.conf.settings`: settings are not populated while the module that
    holds them is still executing.

    **Absence is judged against the framework default, never assumed neutral.**
    A settings module that never declares a name does not thereby switch the
    behaviour off -- it inherits whatever Django or allauth defaults to, and for
    two of these four that default *is* the forbidden state. So
    `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` and `ACCOUNT_LOGIN_METHODS` refuse when absent, as
    `DJANGO_ADMIN_FORCE_ALLAUTH` already did, while `INSTALLED_APPS` and DRF's
    class list read as empty when absent because their defaults name nothing
    forbidden. This matters now rather than hypothetically: deleting a line is a
    plausible way to remove `ModelBackend` from `base.py:203-206`, and it would
    reinstate the exact state it was meant to remove.

    caller pays and the worker processes have nothing to do.

    **`CELERY_TASK_EAGER_PROPAGATES` is deliberately not refused.** `local.py:110`
    sets it beside the flag above, and it is inert without it -- it decides only
    whether an eagerly executed task re-raises. Refusing on it would create a
    second forbidden state where the architecture settled on one, and would refuse
    a deployed component whose tasks are queued normally.

    Absence is neutral and is the ordinary case: `config/settings/base.py`
    declares neither flag, so a deployed component that never mentions eager
    execution is a component that does not use it.

    Args:
        settings_module: The settings module currently being composed.

    Raises:
        ImproperlyConfigured: When `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER` is truthy. Truthy
            rather than `is True`, because this one is read as a switch by Celery
            itself -- unlike `DJANGO_ADMIN_FORCE_ALLAUTH`, where anything other
            than `True` is the forbidden state and identity is therefore the test.
            The value that makes the difference concrete is the string `"false"`,
            which is what an environment-driven settings module produces from a
            variable nobody parsed: Celery reads it as on, and an `is True` rule
            would read it as off and let it through.
            `tests/unit/startup/test_feature_scoped_refusals.py` drives that exact
            value, so the choice cannot be reverted by an edit that still passes.

#: The stage-1 conditions, in evaluation order, and the order is part of the
#: contract rather than an accident of how they were written: AD-26 requires "one
#: location, one owner, and a fixed order", and
#: `tests/unit/startup/test_stage_one_conditions.py` asserts this tuple.
#:
#: FR-12's escape route is first because it is the one condition that says the
#: *wrong module loaded* -- every condition after it is reading values from a
#: module that had no business executing, so its message is the one that helps.
#: The five that follow are conditions 1 to 5 of the refusal table, in the
#: table's own order.
#:
#: The two feature-scoped conditions are appended here rather than reached by a
#: second call inside `run_stage_one`, so that the dispatch has one shape and the
#: roster has one declaration site (AD-1). They are last because they are the
#: conditional ones: a component meets every refusal it shares with every other
#: combination before it meets one that depends on what it selected.
#:
#: Each entry carries its own marker pair, and that is not tidiness. The
#: materializer removes a region's lines, so a call site left outside the pair
#: would survive into a combination whose definition had gone -- a `NameError`
#: at settings import, which is the failure AD-24's worked example is about.
