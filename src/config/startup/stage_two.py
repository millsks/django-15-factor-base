"""Stage 2 of the refusal contract: the checks that evaluate at process startup.

Invoked from the `AppConfig.ready()` of one named immovable-core app inside
`django_service` (AD-26). `ready()` runs inside `django.setup()`, so this fires
under gunicorn and uvicorn exactly as it does under a management command --
there is no serving-process-only hook to miss, and no `sys.argv` sniffing
anywhere (AD-13 forbids it outright).

`django_service` is `core` in its entirety (AD-29), so the owner travels in all
six combinations by construction and no adopted application can displace it. No
adopted application may precede it in `INSTALLED_APPS` either;
`tests/unit/startup/test_installed_apps_ordering.py` is the gate on that.

Whatever runs here runs at boot, so FR-23 and NFR-1 bind it: no network call,
and no query beyond migration state -- plus the single designated-group
existence read AD-27 requires. `tests/unit/test_no_network_at_boot.py` enforces
the network half by booting this component with every socket refused.

**The sentinel is set first, before the locality check.** What AC #3 asserts is
that the invocation point fires at all under a serving process. Every developer
and CI path runs local (AD-13), so a record written after the `is_deployed()`
early return would never be observed and the test that reads it would assert
nothing.

**Predicates resolve objects, never strings (AD-26).** The two URLconf
conditions walk the resolved configuration and compare *view callables* -- by
identity, by class, and by the module object that defines them. Nothing here
reads a route name, a path prefix or a dotted path, because a rename or a
remount would defeat every one of those and leave the route as reachable as it
was. The one string this module carries out of the walk is the route's location,
interpolated into a refusal message so an operator knows which line to open; no
predicate reads it.

**Imports are deferred into the function that needs them for two different
reasons, and neither is AD-24's conditional import.** AD-24 forbids
`try`/`except ImportError` and imports made conditional on a feature being
present -- a removal mechanism. Every import below is unconditional and always
executes; they are merely placed past a lifecycle boundary.

*The registry-bound two.* `config.startup.stage_two` is imported while a
settings module is still executing (through `config.startup.run_stage_one`) and
again during app loading, and at both of those moments the application registry
is not populated: `rest_framework.authtoken.views` and
`django.contrib.auth.models` each define or import a model class, so a
module-scope import of either raises
`django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady` and takes the whole boot down with
something that is not `ImproperlyConfigured`. Inside the condition bodies the
registry is ready, because stage 2 runs from `AppConfig.ready()`.

*`django.conf.settings`, which is deferred for something else entirely.* It is
**not** a registry problem: `from django.conf import settings` binds a lazy
proxy, reads nothing and touches no registry, and is perfectly safe at module
scope. It is deferred because `config/startup/__init__.py` states the package
convention -- "nothing in this package may import `django.conf.settings` at
module scope" -- and that convention exists because stage 1 runs while a
settings module is still executing, at which point the settings object is not
yet populated and a module-scope binding is a standing invitation to read off it
there. The distinction is written out because a reader who collapses the two
reasons into one will eventually relocate the wrong import.

    Several sources, and all of them are yielded rather than only the innermost,

    * **The callback as routed.** `obtain_auth_token` *is* an
      `ObtainAuthToken.as_view()` product that DRF built once at import time, so
      the identity comparison condition 6 is specified in terms of is only
      available against the object the URLconf actually holds.
    * **The `functools.wraps` chain beneath it.** A decorator applied to a
      forbidden view would otherwise hide it behind a wrapper of its own. The
      chain is walked link by link rather than collapsed with `inspect.unwrap`
      to its terminal, and that difference is load-bearing here: DRF wraps every
      `as_view()` product in `csrf_exempt`, so `inspect.unwrap(obtain_auth_token)`
      returns the inner `View.as_view.<locals>.view` closure and *not*
      `obtain_auth_token`. Yielding only the terminal would silently break the
      identity comparison on the one route this condition exists for.
    * **The `view_class` each layer carries.** `View.as_view()` records the class
      it was built from, which is what recognizes a *fresh* `as_view()` product
      -- a different object every time it is called, and therefore invisible to
      any identity test -- and what gives the defining-module predicate a class
      whose `__module__` is the view's own rather than
      `django.views.generic.base`.
    * **The `cls` a DRF ViewSet carries instead.** `rest_framework.viewsets.ViewSetMixin.as_view()`
      does **not** set `view_class`; it sets `cls`, and its `__wrapped__` chain
      terminates at `APIView.dispatch`. So a `ViewSetMixin` subclass of
      `ObtainAuthToken` registered on `config/api_router.py`'s DRF router --
      which is the shape a token endpoint would most naturally be re-added under
      in this repository -- is matched by none of the three sources above. Both
      attributes are read, because Django's own class-based views and DRF's
      viewsets record the same fact under different names.
    * **A `functools.partial`'s target, and every object in a layer's closure
      cells.** Both exist because the `__wrapped__` chain is a *convention*, not
      a mechanism: a decorator that does not call `functools.wraps` sets nothing
      at all, so the walk would yield only the wrapper and both URLconf
      conditions would read the decorator's own module. A plain closure
      decorator holds its wrapped view in a cell, and a `partial` holds it in
      `func`; reading both is what makes the two conditions survive a wrapper
      that was never written with them in mind. Everything reached this way
      passes `_defining_object` first -- see there for why an unrestricted sweep
      would be dangerous rather than merely noisy.

    **What is still invisible, named rather than implied.** A wrapper that uses
    no `functools.wraps`, is not a `partial`, and does not close over the view --
    one that reaches it through a module global, a registry lookup or an
    instance attribute -- is not found by any of these sources. That residual is

    to repair it, and every local smoke check passes because a developer's
    database was seeded by hand. The misconfiguration must surface as a
    configuration error rather than as a mysterious permissions problem.

    One query, and it creates nothing. `django_service.users.provisioning` is the
    only mechanism in this repository that creates a `Group` row, driven by the
    data migration Story 2.3 delivered; a refusal never repairs, because a
    refusal that repaired would hide the state it exists to report.

    **One alias here, every alias next door, and the asymmetry is correct.**
    `_refuse_unapplied_migrations` iterates every entry in `settings.DATABASES`
    because AD-9 says a schema nobody migrated is the same defect under any
    alias. This condition instead issues one `Group` query, which the default
    router resolves to a single alias. The two are not inconsistent, because
    they are asking different questions: a *schema* exists once per database,
    while the designated groups are `auth` rows and live wherever the router
    sends `auth` -- one place, by definition, since a second copy under another
    alias is not a second requirement but the same rows read through a different
    connection. Iterating aliases here would refuse a component whose contributed
    reporting database (Epic 9) legitimately carries no `auth_group` table at
    all. The alias the query actually resolved to is read off the queryset and
    named in nothing but the connection bookkeeping below, never in a predicate.

    The connection is closed again when this condition is what opened it, for
    the reason `_refuse_unapplied_migrations` states: a socket left open across
    `django.setup()` is a `gunicorn --preload` fork hazard. It is *not* closed
    when the alias was already connected, because that connection may be inside
    a transaction the caller owns.

    Raises:
        ImproperlyConfigured: When either designated group has no matching row.
            The message names exactly which of the two is missing -- both, when
            both are -- and the variable that configured the name.
