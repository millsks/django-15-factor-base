# FR-44 / AD-31: sessions are database-backed, and the engine is stated here
# rather than inherited. Django's own global default happens to be this same
# string, so the line changes no behaviour today -- which is precisely why it is
# worth writing. What it removes is the *dependence on a default*: a value the
# component never states is a value a Django release note can move, and one that
# a feature's settings fragment can quietly redefine.
#
# The Redis feature may not change it. Two of the six combinations ship no Redis
# at all, so a cache-backed engine would make session behaviour a property of an
# unrelated toggle -- per-replica sessions in those two LocMem combinations, where
# a user's session then depends on which replica answered. That is the NFR-3
# statelessness failure this setting exists to prevent, and it is why this
# assignment sits **outside every `feature:<name>` region**: an assignment inside
# a region is an assignment the materializer removes from every component that
# did not select that region's feature, whichever feature that turns out to be.
#
# No `cached_db` variant "for performance", and no `SESSION_CACHE_ALIAS`: both
# reintroduce the toggle dependency the explicit engine removes.

# The Bearer credential (FR-5, AD-23). Every value below is read here so that

# `COMPONENT_OIDC_JWKS_URL` is an override, not a second trust anchor: unset, the
# location is derived from `OIDC_ISSUER` above. AD-23's startup refusal for a
# location not derived from the issuer is Epic 4's, and it consumes
# `config.authorization.jwks.jwks_url_derives_from_issuer`. That check is
# syntactic and can be nothing else -- confirming a location against the issuer's
# discovery document would mean fetching it at boot, which FR-23 forbids.

# few seconds of drift between the IdP's clock and this host's produces
# intermittent 401s with no diagnosable cause, and the only alternative is
# telling an operator to fix NTP on a machine they may not own. Raising it is a
# deliberate widening of the credential window: a token is accepted for this many
# seconds *past its own `exp`*, so the value is the amount of extra life every
# token in the deployment gains. Keep it in single-digit seconds.

# revocation window, which governs authorization rather than key material.
#
# Clamped to a floor rather than taken as given: at zero or below, every lookup
# sees the cache as expired and each one attempts a fetch, so the JWKS document
# is re-fetched as fast as the refetch window permits for the life of the
# process. A minute is the shortest lifetime that still makes the cache a cache.

# random `kid` values produces one fetch per request against the IdP's JWKS
# endpoint. Lowering it towards zero is what re-arms that amplification.
#
# Clamped for that reason, and this floor is the load-bearing one: at zero or
# below the comparison `now - last_attempt < window` is false for every caller,
# which disables the rate limit outright and re-arms exactly the amplification
# this module was written to prevent. A configuration mistake must not be able to
# turn that off, so the floor is enforced here rather than documented as advice.
