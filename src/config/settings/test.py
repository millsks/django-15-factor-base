# AUTHENTICATION
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The local username-and-password path, declared here and refused in a deployed
# component by stage 1's condition 2 (states a and b). `base.py` carries neither:
# it is the surface a deployed component inherits, and a base that carried them
# made every deployment refuse to start.
#
# `ModelBackend` is what persona sign-in hands `django.contrib.auth.login` as
# `config.local_dev.views.SESSION_BACKEND`. `login()` does not check that the
# backend it is given is declared -- `get_user` does, on the *next* request, and
# answers `AnonymousUser` when it is not, so an undeclared backend produces a
# sign-in that returns 302 and a session gone by the redirect.
#
# The login method is allauth's own form, which a developer uses to reach `/admin/`
# without an identity provider running. Both are locality-scoped affordances, and
# they are declared where the locality is for the same reason the cache and task
# substitutions are.
#
# Appended rather than respelled: a second full list would agree with `base.py` on
# the day it was written and drift the first time either changed. Allauth's backend
# stays first, so it answers before Django's own.

# test already forces eager execution itself -- which is the point: they make the
# substitution visible to a reader and assertable by a test.

# such call -- it is a fragment consumed through `from .base import *`, and a
# call at its end would fire before this module had finished composing.
