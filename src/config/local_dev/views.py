"""The local sign-in views: the one mechanism by which a persona gets a session.

AD-21 makes this a URL route "and by no other mechanism -- not a development
authentication backend, not a management command that writes a session, not a
query-parameter shim". Everything in this module exists to keep that true, and
three properties carry it.

**It holds no mapping logic.** The views build a synthetic claims payload with
`personas.build_claims` -- the sole constructor, shared with the seeding task and
with Story 3.5's token minting -- and hand it to `resolve_user` and then
`sync_for_interactive`, exactly as an interactive IdP login does. Nothing here
reads a persona's groups to set anything on a user, writes `is_staff` or
`is_superuser`, or decides a permission. That is AD-11 and AD-10: the mapper owns
identity and authorization, and the whole value of this route is that the mapper
cannot tell which path handed it the claims. A branch here that promoted the
staff persona would make the local behaviour agree with the deployed behaviour by
coincidence rather than by construction, and the disagreement would surface in
production.

`sync_for_interactive` and never `sync_once_per_epoch`: an interactive login *is*
the epoch, carries no `jti`, and routing it through the epoch gate would make a
changed declaration apply once and never again.

**Signing in is a `POST`.** The index is a `GET` that lists what can be signed in
as; the act itself is `POST`-only. A credential path reachable by following a
link is a drive-by session -- a page anywhere, a prefetch, or an image tag would
establish one -- and the persona is selected by a *path segment* rather than a
query parameter, which AD-21 names as a forbidden shape in its own right.

**They refuse unless the run is local.** The first statement of each view asks
`config.locality.is_local()` and raises `Http404`. That is defence in depth
behind the URLconf gate in `config/urls.py`, not a substitute for it, and it is
`Http404` rather than `ImproperlyConfigured` deliberately: a view reached in a
deployed component must not answer 500 with a configuration message, because that
announces the path exists and turns a guarded route into an error-rate signal.
The seeding task's `ImproperlyConfigured` is right for something an operator
invoked and wrong for something a stranger requested.

The method check is written out rather than delegated to `require_POST`, and the
order is the reason. A decorator runs *before* the function body, so a
`require_POST`-wrapped view answers `405` to a `GET` without ever reaching the
locality guard -- and `405` is not "nothing": it confirms the path exists and
that only the verb was wrong, which is the disclosure the `404`-over-
`ImproperlyConfigured` choice above exists to avoid. Locality is asked first, so
a route that became reachable in a deployed component answers `404` to every
verb.

The module's *location* is load-bearing. Epic 4's stage-2 predicate resolves the
URLconf and refuses any route whose view callable belongs to `config.local_dev`
(AD-26: predicates resolve objects, never strings). So these callables stay here,
un-relocated and un-re-exported, and any decorator applied to them must preserve
`__module__`.
