"""OpenTelemetry tracing setup.

Configuration comes from the standard `OTEL_*` environment variables rather
than project-specific settings, so anything that already knows OpenTelemetry
knows how to configure this application.

Tracing is always wired in; only *export* is conditional. Registering a
`BatchSpanProcessor` whose collector is unreachable makes the exporter retry on
every cycle and flood stderr, which would happen on every test run and every
`runserver`. So the OTLP processor is attached only when an endpoint is
configured. Instrumentation stays active either way, so `trace_id` still
reaches the logs with no collector present.

    function for refusal condition 3, which refuses a deployed component that
