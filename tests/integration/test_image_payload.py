"""The payload properties, verified by building the image and running it (FR-38, FR-39).

`tests/unit/test_payload_properties.py` asserts what the `Dockerfile` *declares*
and what the settings *resolve to*. Both are necessary and neither is the claim.
The claim AD-15 makes is behavioural -- the component starts from environment
variables alone, under a UID the image has never seen, on a read-only root
filesystem, and writes nothing outside a temporary directory -- and the only
thing that establishes it is a container that has actually done so.

**Two runs, because one cannot prove both things.** `docker diff` on a
`--read-only` container is trivially empty and proves nothing: the runtime
refused every write, so an image that wanted to write all over `/app` would look
identical to one that wanted nothing. So the no-writes claim is asserted against
a **writable** run -- every changed path must be under the temporary directory --
and the start-up claim is asserted against a **`--read-only --tmpfs /tmp`** run.
Both use `--user 12345:0`, a UID that appears nowhere in the image and has no
`/etc/passwd` entry; group 0 is how an arbitrary-UID platform grants access, and
`chgrp -R 0 /app && chmod -R g=u /app` in the image is what makes it work.

**pixi's task cache is redirected by the image, not by this harness.**
`pixi run <task>` writes `/app/.pixi/task-cache-v0/<env>-<task>-<hash>.json` when
the task completes, and the write is **not** optional: it happens after the task's
own exit status is known, and when it fails pixi exits non-zero with the task's
output already printed. Under `--read-only` that is `Read-only file system (os
error 30)`; under the image's `g=rX` tree it is `Permission denied (os error 13)`,
which is how a `manage migrate` that applied every migration and reported success
still failed the release stage.

An earlier revision of this module mounted a tmpfs over that directory and
described the write as an optimisation pixi carries on without. That was wrong on
both counts, and it put the workaround in the wrong place besides: a deployment
platform mounts `/tmp` and knows nothing about pixi's internals, so a payload that
needs a second mount to run read-only does not have the property this module
claims to verify. The image now symlinks that directory to `/tmp`, and the runs
below use a plain `--read-only --tmpfs /tmp`, which is what a platform actually
provides.

**The release stage runs first, and that is Story 5.5's contract demonstrated
rather than violated.** `_refuse_unapplied_migrations` fires for serving
processes, so `web` will not boot against a database nobody has migrated. The
harness therefore performs the release stage itself, as a separate non-serving
invocation of the same image, running exactly the steps `component.toml`
declares through `pixi run manage <step>` -- which is what
`docs/deployment.md` tells a deployment repository to do. The *image* still
declares no migrating instruction, which is what AD-22 forbids and what
`tests/unit/test_release_stage.py` holds.

**Two variables the harness sets that no deployment would.**
`DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, because `production.py` defaults it to a public hostname
and the probes arrive at a published port on localhost; and
`DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=False`, because it defaults to true and
`SecurityMiddleware` would 301 a plain-HTTP probe -- there is no
`SECURE_REDIRECT_EXEMPT` in this repository. Sending `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`
would work equally; the variable is the clearer statement in a test.

**Docker is a capability guard, not a dodged gate.** The module skips where
`docker` is not on `PATH`, which is a developer-machine accommodation: the gate
runs on Linux with Docker available, so these assertions execute there. The
exemption is recorded in `tests/unit/test_suite_policy.py`'s table like any
other, and it is a `skipif` on a capability rather than a `skip` on a failure --
there is no state here to be permissive about, only a tool that may be absent.

**Disposition `machinery`, with `tests/unit/test_payload_properties.py` and with
the `Dockerfile` itself.** These assertions do not run inside a materialized
combination's gate, because a materialized component ships no Dockerfile to
build (AD-15). Epic 7 lists all three explicitly in `accelerator.toml`; AD-2's
input reconciliation fails a path claimed by no disposition, and defaulting to
`machinery` is not the same as declaring it.

**State is left as it was found.** Every fixture removes what it created --
containers, the network, and the image -- in teardown, whatever the assertions
did.

These are integration tests: they build an image, start containers and open
sockets. `tests/integration/conftest.py` marks the directory.

    turns a database blip into a restart loop. Readiness answers 200 only once

    above made possible.
