"""Tests for the process model AD-14 declares across `pixi.toml` and `component.toml`.

The process model is two halves of one fact held in two files. `pixi.toml` says
how each process type is *run* -- `web`, `worker` and `beat` are pixi tasks, so
the deployment repository invokes `pixi run <process>` and enumerates the set
with `pixi task list`, and there is no Procfile. `component.toml` says what each
process type *needs* -- replica counts and replacement strategy, which no task
can express and no deployment repository can infer.

The halves drift silently, which is why the gate on them is **two-way**: every
process type the declaration names has a matching task, *and* every task in the
process group is named by the declaration. One direction alone is not enough.
A declaration naming a task nobody wrote gives the deployment repository a
process it cannot start; a `worker` task surviving into a component with no
Celery gives it a process it should never have started, which is the failure
AD-14 names.

Membership in the process group is **structural, not nominal** (AD-26): the group
is exactly the set of tasks whose `env` declares `COMPONENT_PROCESS`. Deriving it
from a name, a prefix or a comment is the failure mode AD-26 names for
predicates, and it applies here for the same reason -- a task called `web-2` is
in the group if it declares the variable and out of it if it does not, whatever
its name suggests.

Two neighbouring facts are asserted elsewhere and deliberately not repeated here:

* `tests/unit/test_locality_declaration.py::test_only_serving_process_tasks_declare_a_process_type`
  and `::test_serving_process_tasks_declare_no_runtime` own the other half of
  AD-13's task-`env` contract. Both were written to pass vacuously until this
  story landed the tasks; they go live with it rather than being duplicated here.
* `::test_component_process_absent_from_every_activation_env` owns the absolute
  prohibition on `COMPONENT_PROCESS` in an activation env. Why that one is fatal
  is worth restating even where it is not asserted: the golden base runs pixi, so
  an activation env reaches production, and `COMPONENT_PROCESS` placed in one
  would make *every* management command declare itself a serving process --
  `pixi run migrate` included, a release-stage step, which then refuses on the
  unapplied-migrations condition and deadlocks the release.

Two variances are recorded rather than worked around. The six-combination
`[environments]` matrix does not exist yet (Epic 8, Story 8.1), so AC #4's "any
of the six combinations" and AC #5's "a combination without background task
processing" are asserted here *structurally* -- `web` outside any region,
`worker` and `beat` inside the `celery` region -- and per combination in Epic 8,
which extends both these assertions and the activation-env ones over each
*materialized* `pixi.toml`. And `accelerator.toml` does not exist, so the AD-24
region placed in `pixi.toml` here is declared in Epic 7; the markers are the
whole mechanism until then.

These read the manifests rather than executing the gate, so they are unit tests:
no I/O beyond reading repository files, no network, no database.

**Where the manifest reader went.** The walk over `pixi.toml`'s task tables, and
with it the structural definition of the process group, moved to
`tests/pixi_manifest.py` when Story 5.5 needed the same group to assert that no
member of it migrates (AD-22). It is imported from there rather than copied,
because two readers that can disagree about what the process group *is* would let
a task escape one module's assertions while satisfying the other's -- the failure
mode AD-26 names for the refusal contract, arriving through the tests. Nothing
about the definition changed in the move; the region assertions below still read
text, because a region is a span of lines that no parse preserves.
