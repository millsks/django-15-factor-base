"""Tests for both branches of the package version lookup.

`src/django_service/__init__.py` reads its version from installed distribution
metadata and falls back to `0.0.0` when there is none -- a bare checkout, or a
source tree imported without being installed.

That fallback used to carry `# pragma: no cover`. AD-20 forbids clearing the
coverage floor "by a pragma on unreached code", and a pragma on a branch that a
five-line test can reach is precisely that: the line leaves the denominator, the
percentage rises, and nothing is covered. The pragma is gone and this is what
replaces it -- the branch is covered because it is exercised.

A unit test: it patches an import-time lookup and reloads one module. No
network, no database, no filesystem beyond the import system's own reads.

    would be undone by the very reload it was meant to affect.
