"""CG-3: a refusal raises. It never warns, never logs and continues, never softens.

> "Do not soften a refusal into a warning. A refusal that logs and continues
> makes deployment smoother and puts local credentials into production."

Every other module in this package asserts that a forbidden state *is* refused.
This one asserts the shape of the refusal, which is a different claim and the one
that decays quietly: a condition edited into `logger.warning(...)` and a `return`
still passes a test that only checks the component does not start cleanly, if
that test was written loosely enough. Four assertions, from four directions:

* **A** -- each forbidden state raises `ImproperlyConfigured` and emits no
  warning while doing it. A condition that warns *and* raises is still the wrong
  shape; a condition that warns and returns is the failure CG-3 names.
* **B** -- each forbidden state raises with nothing logged in place of the raise,
  captured through `structlog.testing.capture_logs()`. Logging alongside a raise
  is permitted by CG-3; logging instead of it is not.
* **C** -- the package's source contains no `warnings.warn`, no bare `except:`
  and no exception handler that swallows. Here the project standard and CG-3
  happen to forbid exactly the same three shapes.
* **D** -- every refusal raises `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured`
  specifically, asserted both at runtime (the exact type, not a subclass of
  something broader) and over every `raise` statement in the package. The
  Consistency Conventions fix the type: "Every forbidden or missing configuration
  raises `ImproperlyConfigured` at one of the two refusal stages."

**Which states this module reaches.** Twelve of the fourteen, plus FR-12's escape
route. The two it does not are the stage-2 database states -- unapplied migrations
and an absent designated group -- which need a live connection and are therefore
covered by the same measurements in
`tests/integration/startup/test_stage_two_served_path.py`, whose cases are
parametrized from `DELEGATED_TO_THE_INTEGRATION_SUITE` so that a state named there
and not covered fails on that side. Splitting them that way is what keeps this
module a unit test: it opens no database, no socket and no file beyond reading the
package's own source. That claim rests on the autouse fixture below deleting
`COMPONENT_PROCESS` as well as `COMPONENT_RUNTIME` -- two builders here run stage
2, whose database conditions gate on `is_serving_process()` reading that variable
off the environment, so a shell holding `COMPONENT_PROCESS=web` would otherwise
turn two of these cases into database-touching ones.

Each state is constructed here rather than imported from the module that asserts
its message, because what is under test is different: those modules ask *what* the
refusal said, and this one asks *how* it arrived. A shared builder would make one
module's convenience the other's coverage. Each builder still records **one**
distinguishing substring of the message its state refuses with, and every case
asserts it: stage 1 evaluates a roster in order, so a builder that stopped
constructing its state -- or a condition deleted outright -- would otherwise keep
these cases green under the label of the state no longer being checked.
