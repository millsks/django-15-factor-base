"""The fourteen forbidden states, named -- FR-16's index, not a second contract.

**This module names states. It does not decide them.** Every predicate lives
once, in `src/config/startup/` (AD-26, AD-1), and nothing here reads a setting,
resolves a route or evaluates a condition. What it holds is a stable identifier
per forbidden state, so that `tests/unit/startup/test_refusal_coverage_audit.py`
can reconcile "every state has a test that configures it and asserts the raise"
in both directions. The moment a record here starts carrying a predicate, the
contract has two copies and this file is the wrong one.

**Why fourteen and why the number is not re-derived.** The planning sources are
arithmetically inconsistent -- PRD §4.3 and FR-16 say nine conditions, FR-13 says
seven and lists eight bullets, and AD-27 adds a stage-2 refusal that appears in
no bullet at all. The settled reading, recorded in the epic context and in this
story, is **nine conditions -- seven unconditional and two feature-scoped --
across fourteen distinct forbidden states**, applying FR-16's own rule that one
condition may cover several states each tested separately. Conditions 2, 5 and 6
are the three that do. Do not re-open the arithmetic here; the audit asserts
against this table.

**Two of the fourteen are feature-scoped and leave with their features.** States
8 and 9 are Redis's and Celery's, so their records sit inside AD-24 marker pairs
exactly as the conditions themselves do in `src/config/startup/stage_one.py`: a
combination materialized without Redis has no `_refuse_in_process_cache` and must
not carry a declaration demanding a test for it. The `feature` field on each
record says the same thing to a reader; the markers are what say it to the
materializer, and only the markers are a removal mechanism.

**FR-12's escape route is declared separately, on purpose.** A deployed component
that loaded `config.settings.local` is the failure the whole contract is built
around, but it is not one of the nine numbered conditions -- so it gets its own
record outside `FORBIDDEN_STATES`, asserted by its own case in the audit. Folded
into the tuple it would be tradeable against the fourteen: drop it, add a
fifteenth, and a count-based check would still pass.

Not a test module. `tests/coverage_policy.py` and `tests/factories.py` are the
existing precedent for a helper that lives under `tests/` and is imported rather
than collected -- `[tool.pytest.ini_options] python_files` matches `test_*.py`
and `tests.py`, so pytest collects nothing from this file.
