"""The two forbidden route states, and the two evasions a string match would miss.

Refusal condition 6, both halves: a route whose view callable **is** DRF's
`obtain_auth_token`, and a route whose view callable belongs to the local
sign-in module. AD-26 states the rule these cases are measured against --
"predicates resolve objects, never strings" -- and the two evasion cases are what
make that rule assertable rather than aspirational:

* **Evasion A.** A route named `local_persona_login` mounted under `/accounts/`.
  AD-21 names this shape itself: it satisfies the AD by name and passes an
  allowlist that already permits `/accounts/` for allauth, because
  `config/urls.py` really does mount `allauth.urls` there. A predicate matching
  the URL name or the path prefix passes it; one resolving the view callable's
  defining module does not.
* **Evasion B.** `obtain_auth_token` re-exported under another module attribute
  and mounted under another route name at another prefix. A predicate comparing
  `__name__` or a dotted path passes it; one comparing object identity does not.

The negative case carries as much weight as either. Without a URL configuration
that both conditions *accept*, a predicate that refused everything would satisfy
every refusal assertion in this module and nothing here would notice.

Everything is driven through the public `run_stage_two()` rather than by calling
the conditions directly, so what these cases assert is the behaviour a booting
component actually gets -- the roster, the locality gate and the condition
together. The two database conditions in that roster gate on
`COMPONENT_PROCESS`, which no test process declares (AD-13), so they return
before they query and these stay unit tests: no database, no network, no
filesystem.

Throwaway URL configurations are real module objects registered in `sys.modules`
and installed with `override_settings(ROOT_URLCONF=...)`, built by
`tests.conftest.temporary_root_urlconf`. A list of patterns handed to a resolver
directly would skip the import Django performs and would not exercise
`include()` at all.
