# That keeps the guard closed from both directions. An unacknowledged bump still

# longer covers the runtime is the honest half -- that is exactly what Story 1.9
# did when the pin moved to the LTS series, and the spike is what takes it back.
# Recording that it no longer covers `django-storages` itself would leave a

      inherited across a bump, which is what Story 1.8 built this check for.

      the lock resolves the very release line the verdict *does* name. That is
      the opposite failure and it matters just as much: without it, "out of
      scope" would be a line you write once and never take back, permanently
      exempting a package from the reconciliation.

    A disclaimer is only accepted when it names the release line the lock
    actually resolves, so it cannot be written vaguely enough to cover whatever
    the solver does next. Two further limits make that real rather than nominal:

    * **It may not be coarser than the verdict.** A verdict naming `django 6.0`
      is answered by a disclaimer naming `django 5.2`, not by one naming
      `django 5` -- which would exempt the entire 5.x line, and `5.9` with it,
      from a check whose whole subject is version identity.
    * **It may not name the subject.** Only `DISCLAIMABLE_PACKAGES` -- the
      runtime the verdict was earned *on* -- can be disclaimed. Disclaiming
      `django-storages` or `boto3`, which the verdict is *about*, would leave a
      recorded "proven" that is a statement about nothing at all.

    * AC #3's branch is *not* taken. A failed verdict would have added a
      time-boxed `[pypi-dependencies]` entry with its exit condition beside it,
      pending a conda-forge feedstock push. The package resolves from
      conda-forge as it stands, so no such entry exists and none may appear.
    * AC #2's branch is taken, but not by this story. A passing verdict lets
      Epic 7 Story 7.5 build object storage on the channel build; it does not by
      itself move the declaration into `[dependencies]`. Until Story 7.5 does
      that, a `django-storages` in the runtime set is a feature committed to
      without the feature existing, which is what FR-50 exists to prevent.

    If Story 7.5 moves it, this test moves with it -- it becomes an assertion
    that the package sits in the `storage` feature. It does not get deleted, and
    it may not be moved while the verdict is disclaimed, which is the third
    assertion below.

    **A disclaimed verdict may not be built on.** While the verdict block
    records an "Out of scope:" runtime -- as it has since Story 1.9 moved the pin
    to the 5.2 LTS series without re-running the spike -- the verdict is the
    manifest's own statement that it no longer describes what this project
    ships. Acting on it then is acting on evidence the file next to the action
    disowns. So the staging is *coupled* to the disclaimer rather than merely
    coinciding with it: re-run `pixi run spike-storage`, re-record the verdict
    and delete the disclaimer first; only then may `django-storages` reach a
    runtime table.

    "Nowhere else" is checked against **every** dependency table, not the two at
    the top level. `[feature.dev.dependencies]` is a declaration site exactly as
    real as `[dependencies]`, and putting the package there would place it in the
    environment the entire product test suite runs in -- a commitment in all but
    name, and one the earlier two-table form of this test passed cleanly.

    with a green gate: someone bumps Django, `pixi install` re-solves, and
    `pixi.toml` goes on certifying a verdict against a runtime nobody re-spiked
    -- which Epic 7 Story 7.5 is instructed to act on.

    This is what closes that. The versions are read out of the comment a reader
    actually believes and reconciled, per platform, against what `pixi.lock`
    resolved for the environment the spike runs in. Matching is at the verdict's
    own precision: "Django 6.0" is satisfied by a locked `6.0.8` and not by
    `6.1.0`.

    Story 1.9 is the first time it fired for real -- the Django pin moved to the
    5.2 LTS series and the spike had run against 6.0 -- so the rule now admits
    the one other honest answer besides re-running the spike: the block may
    record, in an "Out of scope:" line naming the runtime, that the verdict does
    not cover what the lock resolves. It may not record that vaguely (the line
    has to name the release line the lock actually holds) and it may not record
    it permanently (a disclaimer that no longer contradicts the verdict fails).

    A reader that partitioned on the first occurrence would leave a second
    "Out of scope:" line sitting in the file, looking like a record and
    reconciled against nothing -- the quietest way to disclaim a runtime without
    the gate ever seeing it. Merging every occurrence is what closes that, and
    the sentence bound is what keeps the merge honest: `pixi.toml`'s own
    out-of-scope note *mentions* the other label in prose, and a mention is not a
    listing. The em-dash spelling is here too, because `docs/development.md`
    writes one where `pixi.toml` writes ``--``.
