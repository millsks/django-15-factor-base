"""Tests for `component.toml` and the loader that reads it (AD-28).

Two halves, and they check different things.

The **schema** half is asserted against the repository's own `component.toml`.
It is the file that travels, so what it says is what every materialized component
inherits: an entry that drifted here drifts everywhere at once. These cases read
the committed file and nothing else.

The **loader** half is asserted against declarations written into `tmp_path`.
Every refusal the loader can raise gets a case, because a refusal nothing
exercises is a refusal nobody has seen work -- and because AD-20's floor counts
the error branches like any other line. `load_component_declaration` takes a
path precisely so these cases supply one rather than monkeypatching a
module-level constant, which would be a second declaration site for where the
file lives.

The placement rule (AC #3) is checked mechanically rather than by reading the
prose: the top-level key set has to be a subset of the closed set, which is what
fails when somebody puts a disposition, a parameter site or a preset into the
file that travels instead of into `accelerator.toml`.

These are unit tests. They read committed repository files and write into
`tmp_path`; no network, no database, no other filesystem surface.
