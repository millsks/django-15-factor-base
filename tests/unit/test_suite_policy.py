"""Tests for the policy the test suite itself must obey.

Story 1.2 moved the gate onto PostgreSQL (FR-32). Its AC #2 has two halves. The
first -- "every failure arising from sqlite-permissive behaviour is fixed at its
source" -- was vacuous when the story ran, because PostgreSQL surfaced no
failures at all. The second half is not vacuous, and it is not about that run:
no failure may be *dodged* rather than fixed, ever. That obligation was checked
once, by hand, with grep. This file is what keeps it checked.

The forms banned here are the ones a developer reaches for when a test fails
only in CI: skipping it, marking it `xfail`, or branching on the connection's
vendor so the assertion applies on one backend and not the other. Each converts
a refusal into a warning, which CG-3 forbids, and each would make the gate's
move to PostgreSQL cosmetic.

Matched on the parsed syntax tree rather than by text search. Prose about the
prohibition -- which this module and `tests/integration/test_postgres_schema.py`
both contain -- is then not itself an offence, and `assert connection.vendor ==
expected` (an assertion, the opposite of an evasion) is distinguished from
`if connection.vendor == ...` (a branch), which a grep cannot do.

The ban is absolute except where a decision was recorded, and a recorded
exemption is counted rather than described: `RECORDED_EXEMPTIONS` below licenses
a fixed *number* of a fixed form in a fixed file -- one `pytest.skip(...)` in
`integration/test_import_resolution.py`, say, for a dependency that has no build
on one of the three declared platforms. A second `pytest.skip` in that same file
fails the gate exactly as it would anywhere else, which is the point: the
exemption is a licence for one decision that was recorded, not for the file.

The scan reads every `.py` under `tests/`, not only the modules pytest collects.
An evasion written into an imported helper suppresses a test just as effectively
as one written into the test, so a scan keyed on collection names would be a ban
with a door in it -- and the door would open by renaming a file.

This is a unit test: it reads repository files and parses them, and opens no
network or database connection.

#
# integration/test_import_resolution.py -- Story 1.6, AC #4. The gunicorn leg of
# the three-runtime proof. gunicorn is POSIX-only and has no conda-forge win-64
# build, so pixi.toml declares it (with uvicorn-worker) under
# [target.linux-64.dependencies] and [target.osx-arm64.dependencies] only. On
# win-64 the package is genuinely absent: this is a dependency that cannot be
# installed, not a backend-permissiveness failure being dodged, and AD-18 keeps
# the six-combination harness Linux-only for the same reason. Story 1.6 Task 5
# requires the runtime `pytest.skip` over `@pytest.mark.skip` exactly so the leg
# still runs on every platform that can run it.
# spikes/spike_django_storages_fitness.py -- Story 1.8, Task 6. R-1's
# django-storages fitness spike. Its optional round-trip leg needs a live
# S3-compatible endpoint, which nothing in this repository stands up. The leg is
# armed by an explicit opt-in, `SPIKE_STORAGE_ROUND_TRIP`, rather than by the
# presence of an endpoint variable: gating on "AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL is set" meant
# a developer with an AWS profile already exported had the leg write to,
# overwrite in and delete from whatever bucket their shell named, on the
# strength of running the documented command. The skip message reports the
# resulting bound in the same words as the verdict recorded beside the
# declaration in pixi.toml. The spec requires the runtime `pytest.skip` over
# `@pytest.mark.skip` for the same reason Story 1.6 did: the leg still runs
# wherever the resource exists. It is not a dodged gate failure -- the whole
# module runs outside the gate, in the `spike-storage` environment, and cannot
# dodge anything the gate asserts.
# unit/test_release_stage.py -- Story 5.5, Task 1. The Dockerfile half of AD-22's
# "no entrypoint, task or container command runs migrations". `Dockerfile` does
# not exist in this repository yet: Story 5.6 lands it as `machinery` so the
# harness can verify the FR-38/FR-39 payload properties, and materialized
# components ship none at all (AD-15). The assertion is written now, against the
# instruction lines the file will have, and skips with an explicit reason while
# the file is absent -- which is a *sequencing* accommodation and not a dodged
# gate failure: there is no state here to be permissive about, only a file that
# has not been written. The spec requires the runtime `pytest.skip` over
# `@pytest.mark.skip` for the same reason the two entries above do, and this one
# additionally retires itself: the case runs the moment the file appears, and
# Story 5.6's task list carries the obligation that it must pass on that day.
# integration/test_image_payload.py -- Story 5.6, Task 5. The FR-38/FR-39 payload
# properties, verified by building the machinery image and running it under
# `--user 12345:0 --read-only --tmpfs /tmp`. It skips where `docker` is not on
# `PATH`, and the form is the difference: this is a `@pytest.mark.skipif` on a
# *capability* rather than a `pytest.skip` inside a case, because the whole module
# needs the tool and there is no per-case decision to take. It is not a dodged
# gate failure for the same reason the gunicorn entry above is not: the gate runs
# on Linux with Docker available (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), so every assertion
# here executes there, and what the guard accommodates is a developer machine
# without the tool installed rather than a backend that behaves permissively.
# One occurrence, at module scope: a second `skipif` in this file would be a
# second decision and fails the gate exactly as it would anywhere else.
# coverage_policy.py -- Story 3.6. The AD-20 assertions' shared guard, and the
# entry the widened scan below brought into view rather than a new decision. It
# skips when `--cov` was never passed at all, which is `pixi run
# test-integration` in the inner loop and the one case AD-20's reading sanctions;
# coverage *requested* and not running is the gate defect, and that branch calls
# `pytest.fail`. The guard was written into a helper module partly because the
# scan reached only `test_*.py` and `conftest.py`, which is the door this scan no
# longer leaves open: the decision is recorded here instead, where a second skip
# in that module fails the gate like anywhere else.
