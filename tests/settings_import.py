"""How the suite imports a settings module fresh, in one place.

Two modules import the settings modules again, at run time, to assert what they
*compose* from the environment rather than what Django materialised at start-up.
`tests/unit/test_settings.py` asserts the values themselves; Story 5.6's
`tests/unit/test_payload_properties.py` asserts the payload properties that fall
out of them -- no file-based log handler, a session store that writes nothing to
local disk. Both need the same three things first, and each of the three is a
way a fresh import goes quietly wrong.

*The module has to actually be re-imported.* `config.settings.base` is evicted
alongside every target, because the `from .base import *` in each leaf would
otherwise reuse an already-imported copy and the environment the caller just set
would never be read.

*The environment has to be the caller's and nobody else's.* A developer with
`DJANGO_DEBUG=True` exported gets a different `DEBUG`, a different composed
`LOGGING` renderer and a different answer from an assertion that never mentioned
either. `import_settings` clears the whole `DJANGO_*` and `COMPONENT_*` surface
before it sets what the caller asked for, so the import reads a stated
environment rather than an inherited one.

*structlog has to be put back.* `src/config/settings/base.py` calls
`configure_structlog()` at module scope, so **importing a settings module
reconfigures structlog for the whole process**. A module that re-imports four of
them across a dozen cases and restores nothing leaves the last configuration
standing, which blinds `structlog.testing.capture_logs()` in any module that
sorts after it -- silently, with no failure in the module that caused it. The
eviction fixture below saves the configuration and restores it in a `finally`.

`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is deliberately not cleared. pytest-django sets it for
the session, `config/settings/production.py` runs stage 1 of the refusal contract
on import and the roster names it, and clearing it would make a fresh import fail
for a reason that has nothing to do with what any caller is asserting.

This is a helper module, not a collected one -- see `tests/pixi_manifest.py` and
`tests/dockerfile.py`, which sit here for the same reason.
