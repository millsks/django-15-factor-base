"""Fixtures shared by the unit suite and the integration suite.

`no_network` lives here rather than in `tests/unit/conftest.py` because both
halves of FR-23 need it: the boot assertions are unit tests and the persona
seeding assertion is an integration test against a real database.

`valid_deployed_settings_namespace` is here for the same reason. Every module
that constructs a stage-1 or stage-2 case needs a settings namespace that every
condition accepts, and they are split across both suites -- `tests/unit/startup/`
holds most of them and `tests/integration/startup/` holds the ones that need a
real connection -- so a `tests/unit/` home would have to be copied. One builder
is what keeps "valid" meaning the same thing everywhere: the moment a story adds
a condition, the namespace that satisfies it is edited once and every caller
inherits the change rather than a fixture per module drifting until some of them
assert over a namespace that refuses.

The callers are deliberately not listed here. A roster in a docstring goes stale
without anything failing -- this one already had, naming three modules when there
were seven -- and `grep valid_deployed_settings_namespace` answers the question
accurately at the moment it is asked.

`pytest_collection_modifyitems` below is the collection side of FR-16's coverage
audit. It reads the `forbidden_state` markers off collected items -- pytest's own
machinery, never a source scan -- and writes them out when a run is asked to
report them.

`subprocess_env` is here for the shared-home reason the two URLconf builders are.
It began in `tests/integration/startup/conftest.py`, which is where the boot
probes live; `tests/unit/startup/test_refusal_coverage_audit.py` then needed the
same environment for its collection child, and a unit module importing an
integration package's conftest is the cross-import that file exists to prevent.
One builder is what keeps "the environment a child probe runs in" meaning the
same thing on both sides.

#: child that inherited it would never exercise the `os.environ.setdefault` in
#: `config/asgi.py` that a server process relies on.
#:
#: The database-selection variables go for a reason that cost a day to find: a
#: probe supplies its own throwaway database and must boot the same way whatever
#: the developer's shell holds. Inherited, a `DATABASE_URL` pointing at
#: PostgreSQL makes `base.py` select the postgres engine, and a probe's sqlite
#: *filename* is then handed to it as a database NAME -- which fails on
#: PostgreSQL's 63-character limit rather than on anything the test is about. The
#: suite passed only on machines with no database configured.
#:
#: The `COV_CORE_*` set is pytest-cov's subprocess activation, read by the
#: `pytest-cov.pth` file in site-packages. Left in place, every child probe
#: writes a `.coverage.<host>.<pid>.<random>` file into its working directory --
#: the repository root for most of them -- and measures a process whose coverage
#: nothing combines. Dropping them is what keeps a probe from leaving artifacts

    7 with it, and `tests/integration/test_release_stage.py` drives AD-22's
    release-stage contract with it -- and the setup has a silent failure mode

    That failure mode: `override_settings(DATABASES=...)` alone is not enough.
    `django.db.connections` caches the mapping it was configured with, and no
    `setting_changed` receiver refreshes it, so the override makes
    `settings.DATABASES` name the extra alias while `connections[alias]` still
    raises `ConnectionDoesNotExist` -- a state in which the subject cannot be

    `:memory:` for the same reason the engine is sqlite: an in-memory database is
    gone the moment its connection closes, so a case built on this leaves no
    artifact anywhere, whatever it did inside the block.

    Every mutation of global state happens *inside* the `try`, and the restore
    runs whatever happens to the teardown of the connection itself. Both
    orderings matter and neither is cosmetic: `connections[alias]` raising with

    """Fail the test, loudly and by address, if anything opens a socket.

    Guarded at the socket layer rather than at `requests`, `urllib` or `httpx`:
    a guard installed on one library proves nothing about the library the code
    actually reached for, and OpenTelemetry's exporters, allauth and PyJWT do
    not all use the same one. `socket.socket.connect`, `socket.socket.connect_ex`,
    `socket.create_connection`, `socket.getaddrinfo` and `socket.gethostbyname`
    are the chokepoints every one of them goes through.

    **What it cannot see.** Connectionless UDP -- `sendto` and `sendmsg` on an
    unconnected socket -- is not guarded, because nothing in this stack sends
    UDP. Network I/O performed inside a C extension is outside its reach
    altogether: libpq above all does its own socket work in C and never touches
    Python's `socket` module, so a PostgreSQL connection is invisible here.

    **Never autouse.** `tests/integration/test_import_resolution.py` opens real
    `AF_INET` sockets to find a free port and to wait for a served subprocess to
    accept connections; a global guard would fail those outright, and blocking a
    test's own infrastructure masks a real dependency rather than asserting one.
    Loopback is blocked along with everything else, and nothing that requests
    this fixture needs an exemption: the Django test client opens no socket, and
    sqlite opens no socket.

        None. The guard is the effect.
